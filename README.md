# Diseaseâ€“Gene Association Prediction via Biologically Informed Multimodal Heterogeneous Graph

## Introduction
M2HGNN is a novel multimodal fusion method based on heterogeneous graph to predict the disease-gene associations.

## Requirements
- python=3.8.20
- cuda=11.6
- torch=1.13.1
- scikit-learn=1.3.2
- pandas=2.0.3
- numpy=1.24.1
- torch_geometric=2.5.2
- torch_scatter=2.1.1
- torch-sparse=0.6.17
- torch-cluster=1.6.0
- torch-spline-conv=1.2.2

## Qucik Start
`python main.py` to train the model and after that `python model_test.py` to test the DISEASES dataset.

## Data Description
./Dataset:
- assoc_dg.csv: file that used for aligning disease node features
- aasoc_gd.csv: file that used for aligning gene node features
- disease_biobert_fea.csv:  disease embeddings generated by large language model(BioBERT-v1.1)
- disease_mesh_sim.csv: disease similarity matrix calculated by MeSH Treeview.
- DISEASES.csv: disease-gene aasociations extracted from https://diseases.jensenlab.org
- DisGeNET.csv: disease-gene associations extracted from https://github.com/Sue-syx/GlaHGCL
- gene_adj.csv: the adjacent matrix of gene
- gene_expression.csv: gene expressions across tissues or cells

./Raw_Data:
- MeshId_TreeNum.csv: meshid of disease
- disease_name.csv: the disease information used in our research
- pcg_gene.csv: the gene information used in our research extracted from https://github.com/Sue-syx/GlaHGCL
- uniprotkb_Homo_sapiens_AND_reviewed_tru_2025_06_23.xlsx: this file appears to contain reviewed human protein entries downloaded from the UniProtKB database used for gene ontology analyze.
